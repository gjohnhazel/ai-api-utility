always remain api agnostic, this should work with any api. so don't attempt to solve a problem that's happening in an example by hard-coding solutions. Simply focus on improving the prompts so the AI can resolve things better. But when you improve the prompt, do so in an API-agnostic way, something that just challenges the AI to think critically about how to solve it.
For example, if our current example we are using to test is openweathermap.org, you should never specifically add a conditional that deals with OpenWeatherMap's API such as verifying the city, etc.
